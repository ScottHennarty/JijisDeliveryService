1. Explain briefly what your project does and how it works.

     In our project we are going to have the character explore a small, pre-made map that has 3 "keys" the player needs
     to find in order to bring back to the start in order to win. Throughout the map there are enemies who will chase
     the player when they get within a certain radius of the player and if they catch the character you loose.

2. List the names of the classes in your project,
   identifying who was the primary author for each.

     Cat- Scott
     Collision_Detection- Neha
     Dog- Scott
     Fish- Scott
     Keys- Scott
     Main- Scott/ Neha
     Positions- Scott/ Neha
     Stamina_Bar- Scott

3. List the essential and other features of your game,
   identifying who was the primary author for each.

4. List the modules (libraries) that you used
   (the things in IMPORT statements).

   that are not your own.

   fairly, beyond what you already said/showed in your video.
